## English Grammer

## The parts of a Sentence

**The subject and predicate: A complete thought**

In English, every sentence needs two parts. The subject and the predicate.

<span style="color: blue">The dog</span> <span style="color: red">runs down the street</span>

<span style="color: blue">Subject</span> <span style="color: red">predicate</span>

without these two parts, the sentence is not a complete thought.

They must be in this order as well.

**The Subject: The Naming Part**

The subject of a sentence is who or what the sentence is about. The subject is a noun. A noun is any person place or thing.

<span style="color: blue">The dog</span> <span style="color: red">runs down the street</span>

<span style="color: blue">Subject</span>

<hr />

**The Predicate: The Telling Part**

The predicate of a sentence tells what the subject is doing. It will start with a verb and contain the object （a noun）.

The dog <span style="color: red">runs down the street</span>

 <span style="color: red">Verb + Object</span>

"<span style="color: red">runs down the street</span>" is the predicate. This tells us what the dog (subject) is doing.

**The Basic Sentence: Subject + Verb + Object**

Now we can build basic English sentences. Knowing only the rules about the subject and predicate.

A basic English sentence is

<span style="color: blue">Subject</span> <span style="color: red">predicate (Verb + Object)</span>

<span style="color: blue">The dog</span> <span style="color: red">runs down the street</span>
